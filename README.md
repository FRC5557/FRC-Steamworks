# FRC Steamworks Code
This repository contains the code used by Team 5557 (BB-R8ERS) during FRC Steamworks.

## Repository Guidelines
- Maintain code cleanliness - the IDE has an organize code function for a reason
- Write code that is easy for someone else to understand; don't give ambiguous names to variables and comment
- Make sure to commit and push all changes to GitHub
- Before editing any code, notify the Slack programming chat regarding which files you are working on
- Remember that two people cannot be working on one file at the same time - this causes GitHub to be confused and throw errors
